*This folder contains the files needed to do vex motors controlled by rasperry pi project with video streaming using piCamera.

Commander.py is python code that trigger GPIO pins to send PWM signal to the vex motor controller by receiving http GET request on local server.

XXX.py is python code that streams picamera video. This code was taken from picamera Docs and only had minor modifications.

xxx.html is webpage to display video stream and control robot with buttons or voice commands.

*circuit:
from vex website
Black Wire - Ground
Orange Wire - Power
White Wire - PWM Signal

We will wire black and orange wires to a dc battery, make sure orange is positive terminal and black is negative otherwise it wont work. White wire will be connected to GPIO pin on rasperry.
